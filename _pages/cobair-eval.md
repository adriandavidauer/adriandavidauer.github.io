Develop a WebApp with Reflex in Python as additional Frontend for CoBaIR and use it to check how much easier and more efficient it is to define a HRI scenario in CoBaIR than with classic Conditional Probability Tables(CPT). Additionally we could test how a LLM performs given a description of the scenario in natural language. Additionally, we could check if a LLM can create the CPT from natural language with Question answering for that use case.
