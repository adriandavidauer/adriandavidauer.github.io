     - Diversity (Age/Gender/Ethnicity/...)
     - Optional: Leakage (Face recognition between test, validation, and training data).
Tasks for this Thesis:
1. Research existing methods to examine (social) datasets for diversity
    - Choose one or more suitable model(s)
1. Research existing social datasets (including VVAD-LRS3 and WildVVAD)
1. Implement a generic python library to analyze facial image and video data
    - Define API
    - Define possible input output formats
    - CLI (optional GUI)
1. Use the library to compare VVAD-LRS3 and WildVVAD (among others)
