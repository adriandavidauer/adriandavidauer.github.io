The Goal of this Paper is to detect when a human drifts and stops listening or understanding. This would allow the robot to ask specific questions to regain attention. An LLM could be informed to shift the speech to something more interesting or engaging.
   - Data could potentially be collected with EEG and fine-tuned on the VVAD-LRS3 dataset.
